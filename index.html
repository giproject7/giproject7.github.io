   <h1 id="titulo"><center>Affordable and clean energy – global goal 7</center></h1> <!--centrar-->
   <h2>Target 7.2 - Increase Global Percentage of Renewable Energy</h2>
   <h3 id="gg">what is a global goal?</h3>
<p>The global goals are targets proposed by the UN (United Nations) to improve lives all around the world. There are 17 goals targeting improvement on the global issues that  affects all of us. </p>
<h2>Global goal 7 - Affordable and clean energy</h2>
<p>Aim: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.</p>
<h3>Global goal 7 – target 7.2:</h3>
<p>Increase Global Percentage of Renewable Energy</p>
<h2>What are renewable energies:</h2>
<p>Renewable energies are ways of obtaining electricity by using renewable sources like:</p>
<ul>
<li>water</li>
<li>sunligh</li>
<li>wind power</li>
</ul>
<p>Which can be obtained by using:</p>
<ul>
    <li>solar panels</li>
    <li>windmills</li>
    <li>hydroelectric turbines</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits of using Renewable Energy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Generating energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and reduces some types of air pollution</li>
<p>-	The greenhouse effect is a process in which the thermal radiation emitted by the planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases and is radiated in all directions. As part of this radiation is returned to the earth's surface and the lower atmosphere, this results in an increase in the average surface temperature</p>
<li>Diversifying energy supply and reducing dependence on imported fuels.</li>
<li>Improved public health</li>
<p>The air and water pollution emitted by coal and natural gas plants is linked with breathing problems, neurological damage, heart attacks, cancer, premature death, and a host of other serious problems.</p>
<li>Among other things</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>These are some ways of using renewable energies in your everyday life:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Solar panels</li>
        <p>Although solar panels have a high list price, they will let you save money long term. And reduce the amount of fossil fuels you use too.</p>
        <li>Electric and hybrid cars</li>
        <p>These cars don’t rely completely on fossil fuels and they are becoming cheaper so more people are being able to buy them</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>New ways of travelling</h2>
    <h3>Hyperloops</h3>
    <p>The Hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes with low air pressure through which a pod may travel substantially free of air resistance or friction. The Hyperloop could convey people or objects at airline or hypersonic speeds while being very energy efficient. This would drastically reduce travel times versus trains as well as planes over distances of under approximately 1,500 kilometres</p>
<p> if you want to know more about hyperloops <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop">here</a> you have a wikipedia page</p>
