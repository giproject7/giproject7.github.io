   <h2>Target 7.2 - Increase Global Percentage of Renewable Energy</h2>
   <h3 id="gg">what is a global goal?</h3>
<p>The global goals are targets proposed by the UN (United Nations) to improve lives all around the world. There are 17 goals targeting improvement on the global issues that  affects all of us. </p>
<h2>Global goal 7 - Affordable and clean energy</h2>
<p>Aim: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.</p>
<h3>Global goal 7 – target 7.2:</h3>
<p>Increase Global Percentage of Renewable Energy</p>
<h2>What are renewable energies:</h2>
<p>Renewable energies are ways of obtaining electricity by using renewable sources like:</p>
<ul>
<li>water</li>
<li>sunligh</li>
<li>wind power</li>
</ul>
<p>Which can be obtained by using:</p>
<ul>
    <li>solar panels</li>
    <li>windmills</li>
    <li>hydroelectric turbines</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits of using Renewable Energy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Generating energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and reduces some types of air pollution</li>
<p>-	The greenhouse effect is a process in which the thermal radiation emitted by the planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases and is radiated in all directions. As part of this radiation is returned to the earth's surface and the lower atmosphere, this results in an increase in the average surface temperature</p>
<li>Diversifying energy supply and reducing dependence on imported fuels.</li>
<li>Improved public health</li>
<p>The air and water pollution emitted by coal and natural gas plants is linked with breathing problems, neurological damage, heart attacks, cancer, premature death, and a host of other serious problems.</p>
    </ul>
